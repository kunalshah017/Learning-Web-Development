    <h1><u>Indian Classical Dance</u></h1>
    <p>Indian classical dance, or Shastriya Nritya, is an umbrella term for various performance arts rooted in religious
        Hindu musical theatre styles, whose theory and practice can be traced to the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra. The
        number of recognized classical dances range from eight to more, depending on the source and scholar. The Sangeet
        Natak Akademi recognizes eight – Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Kathakali, Sattriya, Manipuri and
        Mohiniyattam. Scholars such as Drid Williams add Chhau, Yaksagana and Bhagavata Mela to the list. The Culture
        Ministry of the Government of India includes Chhau in its classical list. These dances are traditionally
        regional,
        all of them include music and recitation in local language or Sanskrit, and they represent a unity of core ideas
        in a diversity of styles, costumes and expression. The Natya Shastra is the foundational treatise for classical
        dances of India, and this text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni. Its first complete compilation
        is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version
        of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia
        Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures,
        acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances.</p>
