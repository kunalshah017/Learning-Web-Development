    <h2>Indian classical music</h2>
    <p>Indian classical music is the classical music of the Indian subcontinent. It has two major traditions: the North
        Indian classical music tradition is called Hindustani, while the South Indian expression is called Carnatic.
        These
        traditions were not distinct until about the 15th century. When the Islamic empire invaded the Indian
        subcontinent,
        the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms.</p>
    <h2>Hindustani classical music</h2>
    <p>Hindustani classical music is the classical music of northern regions of the Indian subcontinent. It may also be
        called North Indian classical music or, in Hindustani, Shastriya Sangeet. Its origins date from the 12th century
        CE,
        when it diverged from Carnatic music, the classical tradition of southern regions of the Indian subcontinent.
    </p>
    <h2>Carnatic classical music</h2>
    <p>Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system of
        music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,
        Telangana,
        Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka. It is one of two main sub-genres of Indian classical music that evolved
        from
        ancient Hindu traditions; the other sub-genre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because
        of
        Persian and Islamic influences in North India.</p>
    <h2>Instruments</h2>
    <p>Indian classical music is always set in a raga. A raga is a melodic scale, consisting of notes from the basic
        seven:
        Sa, Re, Ga, Ma Pa, Dha, Ni, and Sa. The notes are chosen from the seven notes of the scale and arranged in
        ascending
        or descending order to form a melody. The performance is set to a rhythmic cycle called a tala. A tala
        is a rhythmic pattern that consists of a specific number of beats. The most common tala is the tintal, which has
        16
        beats. The performance is accompanied by a drone, which is a continuous sound that is played throughout the
        performance.
        The drone is usually played by a tanpura, which is a stringed instrument that produces a continuous sound. The
        performance
        is also accompanied by a tabla, which is a pair of drums that are played with the hands. The tabla consists of
        two
        drums: the bayan, which is the larger drum, and the dayan, which is the smaller drum. The tabla is played by
        striking
        the drums with the fingers and palms of the hands.</p>

    <h2>Vocal music</h2>
    <p>Vocal music is an important part of Indian classical music. There are two main styles of vocal music in Indian
        classical
        music: dhrupad and khayal. Dhrupad is the older of the two styles and is characterized by its slow tempo and
        long,
        sustained notes. Khayal is a more recent style and is characterized by </p>
