    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Indian classical music</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Indian classical music is the classical music of the Indian subcontinent. It has two
        major traditions: the North Indian classical music tradition is called Hindustani, while the South Indian
        expression is called Carnatic. These traditions were not distinct until about the 15th century. When the Islamic
        empire invaded the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Hindustani classical music</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Hindustani classical music is the classical music of northern regions of the Indian
        subcontinent. It may also be called North Indian classical music or, in Hindustani, Shastriya Sangeet. Its
        origins date from the 12th century CE, when it diverged from Carnatic music, the classical tradition of southern
        regions of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Carnatic classical music</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian
        languages, is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of
        Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka. It is one of two main sub-genres of
        Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions; the other sub-genre being Hindustani music,
        which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian and Islamic influences in North India.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Instruments</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Indian classical music is always set in a raga. A raga is a melodic scale, consisting
        of notes from the basic seven: Sa, Re, Ga, Ma Pa, Dha, Ni, and Sa. The notes are chosen from the seven notes of
        the scale and arranged in ascending or descending order to form a melody. The performance is set to a rhythmic
        cycle called a tala. A tala is a rhythmic pattern that consists of a specific number of beats. The most common
        tala is the tintal, which has 16 beats. The performance is accompanied by a drone, which is a continuous sound
        that is
        played throughout the performance. The drone is usually played by a tanpura, which is a stringed instrument that
        produces a continuous sound. The performance is also accompanied by a tabla, which is a pair of drums that are
        played with the hands. The tabla consists of two drums: the bayan, which is the larger drum, and the dayan,
        which is the smaller drum. The tabla is played by striking the drums with the fingers and palms of the hands.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Vocal music</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Vocal music is an important part of Indian classical music. There are two main styles
        of vocal music in Indian classical music: dhrupad and khayal. Dhrupad is the older of the two styles and is
        characterized by its slow tempo and long, sustained notes. Khayal is a more recent style and is characterized by
        its fast tempo and intricate ornamentation. Both styles are accompanied by a drone and a tabla. The performance
        is usually sung in the language of the region in which it is performed, but it can also be sung in Sanskrit.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
