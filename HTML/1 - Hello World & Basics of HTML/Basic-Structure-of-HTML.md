# HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

- HTML is a markup language that is used to create web pages.
- HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language that tells the browser how to display content.
- HTML uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, etc.
- HTML tags are surrounded by the two characters < and >.


## Basic Structure of HTML

- HTML documents are text files that consist of two parts: **head** and **body**.
- The **head** contains information about the document, such as its title and meta data.
- The **body** contains the actual content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Title of Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    
  
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page.
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab). Title is also used by search engines to rank your page.
- The `<meta>` element contains meta information about the HTML page such as description, author, keywords, etc.

- The `<link>` element defines a link between a document and an external resource such as a font, a CSS file, etc.
- The `<body>` element contains the visible page content.
- The `<script>` element is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
